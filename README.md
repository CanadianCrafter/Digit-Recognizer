# Digit-Recognizer
Digit Recognizer Using Machine Learning Built From Scratch. Here I will attempt to explain how it works.

## Neural Network
* Imagine a neural network a box that takes in an input and returns an output. 
* Inside this box is a series of layers, the first being the input layer, and the last being the output layer; the ones inbetween are hidden layers. 
* Each layer also has a size which is the amount of neurons it holds (think of each neuron as a node in the network). 
* Each node is connected to every node in the layer preceeding it, and following it.
* Each connection is weighted and also given a bias (which in a way, can be thought of as an additional weight). This determines how data is processed.
